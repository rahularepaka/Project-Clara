# Project-Clara
CLARA stands for Clable Lifited Automated Robot for Agriculture

# üìö Theory 
A leading cause of Soil compaction is the use of heavy land-based agricultural machinery which leads to loss of air content within the soil
Due to this heavy farm equipment including tractors can exert considerable weight onto the soil surface and consequently into the subsoil

# ü§î Intial Solution to the Problem
At first glance , the solution is to make an aerial droid or drone to carry out the agricultural processes
But the aerial devices like drones may result in the damage of soil and crops  due to the external pressure exerted by the propellers

# üí° Solution - Project CLARA
We decided to do Cable Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) which can carry out different agriculture processes and can work in indoor and outdoor environments
So we made CLARA (Cable Lifted Automated Robot for Agriculture) is CDPR and her motion is dependent on 8 Motors from which she is suspended using strings
